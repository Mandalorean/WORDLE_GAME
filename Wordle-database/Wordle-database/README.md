Wordle Game implementation

The game takes a 5 letter word from the word.txt document to play the game. The user gets 6 attempts to guess the word right and if he guesses the correct word it takes him to the screen asking to play another game or exit by pressing enter. If the user presses some other key then the game starts again. At the end of the game, the statistics of the game are showed.
